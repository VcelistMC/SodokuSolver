# Sodoku Solver
A java application that uses backtracking to solve a 
sodoku board

you can edit the grid variable to change the sodoku board in Main.java
```java
//change this to get change the board values
//Empty cells are denoted by a zero
int[][] grid = { 
    {3, 0, 6, 5, 0, 8, 4, 0, 0}, 
    {5, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0}, 
    {0, 8, 7, 0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 1}, 
    {0, 0, 3, 0, 1, 0, 0, 8, 0}, 
    {9, 0, 0, 8, 6, 3, 0, 0, 5}, 
    {0, 5, 0, 0, 9, 0, 6, 0, 0}, 
    {1, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 5, 0}, 
    {0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 7, 4}, 
    {0, 0, 5, 2, 0, 6, 3, 0, 0} 
};
```
then run these commands in the project root directory 
```
\> javac src/*.java
\> java Main
```

anyways, sodoku solver go brrrrrr
